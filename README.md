# CNURR â€” Crawler for old EtherPad/Piratenpad

**CNURR** is an automated crawler for backing up your team pads in old EtherPad.

As of now, more and more servers hosting [old EtherPad](https://github.com/ether/pad) decide to shut it down due to well-known performance and security problems.

## Usage

(to be written here)

## SAQ (Supposedly Askable Questions)

**Why would I want to back it up using this tool, if there is standard export tool?**

Default export of old EtherPad completely misses the changes and, most importantly, author data.

## Roadmap

- usage without admin access
- in-app authorization
- ???
- HYADESPAD
